Came across this post today:

While I agree that paying sites for access can be a pain, I also understand why people do it. Not everyone is capable of setting up their own site. This could be due to many reasons ranging from time to technical capability. There is a service provided by sites like Medium in hosting and promotion of the content. It is difficult to get your site publicity when starting out. Being in a bigger site that other people are already going to is a huge leg up.

That said, if you have the time to set it up, a site you own is way more flexible than anything you sign up for where someone else hosts it. Check out the post describing how [I made this site](/projects/github_pages/).
