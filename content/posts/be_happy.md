It seems like a tired cliche, do what makes you happy. In America having hobbies that make you happy is
almost seen as a weakness. To the point that it is a
[running joke](https://youtube.com/shorts/WbehP3ljZoM?si=-HZNuqPXLwlOpA5X). I just recently realized how
important it is that you actually do something that makes you happy.

Depression and burn out make it difficult to enjoy yourself. Difficult to do what makes you happy.
However, it is a bad cycle. Not doing what makes you happy makes burn out and depression worse. It
makes it harder to handle the day to day. Taking time to do the things that make you happy makes it
easier to handle other parts of your life.

Let's do a quick experiment. Tell me what you do. Did you just tell me your job or your hobbies? I
venture to say that if you told me your job instead of your hobbies that you may not have a healthy
relationship with doing what makes you happy.
