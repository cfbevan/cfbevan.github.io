Looking up the word "responsible" gives a few definitions:

> Liable to be required to give account, as of one's actions or of the discharge of a duty or trust.

> Required to render account; answerable.

> Involving important duties, the supervision of others, or the ability to make decisions with
> little supervision.

Highlighting some common words here we see required, duty, account, and answerable. Failing
at these often brings up negative feelings. Failing to be answerable, failing our duty. This is why
most people take responsibility seriously and get anxiety when something they feel responsible for
is in jeopardy of failing.

For me, feelings of responsibility were drilled in from a young age by my parents. They were then
solidified as a core tenant in ROTC. Finally exercised in my early career as a programmer taking
responsibility for features and reviews. Now the feeling of responsibility weighs heavily on me in my
day to day work. The weight that it brigs can at times feel overbearing which can lead to burnout.
The biggest revelation that I have had recently is that many of the feelings of responsibility that
I currently have are self imposed. They are not really responsibilities that I have nor are they
anything that anyone but myself cares about. From here on I will refer to true and false
responsibilities. True responsibilities are ones that we are actually accountable fore. False
responsibilities are the ones we burden ourselves with that we create ourselves. The ones that
nobody else really cares about.

Ultimately it is the fear of failing at our responsibilities that leads to burnout. The constant
anxiety weighing on our nerves is not sustainable as human beings. The addition of false responsibilities
on top of our true responsibilities compounds the issue. Through my experience I have seen
three main places where people make the feeling of responsibility worse for themselves; Inaccurate
expectations, taking on responsibilities of others, and failing to let go.

Inaccurate expectations is the leading reason for false responsibilities that we place upon
ourselves. Let's imagine a time where your boss or leader gave you a large, somewhat nebulous task.
You may have felt the immediate responsibility to ensue that task is done as soon as possible and
that you are alone responsible for the task getting done. In my experience, this is often not the
case. A good leader will not set unreasonable expectations that you alone are responsible for the
entire completion of a task in an unreasonable timeline. It is important that when these feelings
of responsibility arise that you clear up expectations with your leadership. For leaders it is
important to strive to make sure that expectations are clear and explicit. In clarifying expectations
you will often find that the expectation is to finish the task much later than you originally expected
or to work with others/delegate the task.

Another source of false responsibilities is when we take on the feeling of responsibility when
in reality the responsibility belongs to someone else. I often have friends come to me at work looking
for help writing Python scripts they use to accomplish tasks they are responsible for. It is easy,
especially when asked by people we are close with, to feel like we are now responsible for the
success of the task we were asked to help with. In reality asking for assistance is a way for them
to fulfil their responsibility. No transference of responsibility truly exists. While it is nice to
help someone, you need to balance that assistance with your true responsibilities.

The final source of false responsibilities is failing to let go. It is common, especially in large
companies, to switch between teams/projects. When you leave one project for another you may still
feel responsible for the success of the project for a multitude of reasons. No matter the reason
these feelings are a false responsibility. As soon as you are off a project you are no longer
truly responsible for its success. Even if that project fails after you leave, that will not reflect
negatively on you. You need to be able to release your past responsibilities to make room for the
responsibilities of the new project.

With time and practice we can identify and remove our false responsibilities alleviating our burden
and anxiety in the process. This practice will alleviate the feeling of burnout and make your working
life just a bit easier.
