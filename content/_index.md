## Hi there 👋

- 😀 My name is Charles
- ✨ Creating bugs since 2004
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Golang
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him

I started my career getting a masters degree in computer science. My master's thesis was using intelligent
conversational agents to mimic people with different inflictions in order to train medical staff how
to talk to and handle patients. I started a PhD program focusing in the usage fo AI in video games,
but realized that academia was not somewhere I wanted to stay. I joined a small company that makes
educational games. I was with them for a little over 6 years. During that time I went from a game
developer through dev ops and eventually to a manager position over multiple technical departments.
It was here that I experienced my first major burnout and swapped careers from gaming to security.
I joined a large security company as a developer and have sine then bounced around different projects
including incident response, threat intelligence, operations support, data engineering, and attack
surface management. While I ultimately despise certificates, I have at some time held an AWS entry
level certificate and a couple SANS certificates (GSEC, GCIH). Over my career I have had experience
in multiple languages including C++, Java, Lisp, Perl, Python, Rust, and Go. I have been using Docker
since its inception and recently started getting in to Kubernetes and OpenShift/OpenStack. I have
worked with both Ansible and Puppet for server automation. I also have experience with GitHub,
GitLab, and Jenkins for CI/CD development.
